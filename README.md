a casual talk about the questions to ask when choosing an SPA framework

The sample app walks through these concerns:

* routing
* resolving dependencies
* validating input
* databinding to a model
* communicating with a server

How are these concerns handled in popular frameworks?

* [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/)
